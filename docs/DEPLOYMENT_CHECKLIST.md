2. Verify bucket size limit matches expected
3. Check available storage quota in Supabase
4. Try smaller file
5. Check browser console for detailed error

### "Permission Denied" on File Upload
**Solution:**
1. Verify user is authenticated
2. Check RLS policies allow insert
3. Verify bucket is not set to private
4. Check user role matches policy conditions
5. Test with admin account

### Files Upload but Don't Appear
**Solution:**
1. Check database table has data
2. Verify folder structure is correct
3. Check RLS policies for select access
4. Verify file_path is stored correctly
5. Check timestamps match upload time

### Signed URLs Not Working
**Solution:**
1. Verify expiry time hasn't passed
2. Check URL hasn't been tampered with
3. Verify bucket name is correct
4. Check file path exists in bucket
5. Try getting new signed URL

### PDF Preview Not Working
**Solution:**
